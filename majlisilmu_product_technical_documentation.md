# Majlis Ilmu Platform — Product + Technical Documentation (Laravel 12, Postgres, Filament, Typesense, UUIDv7)

**Document purpose:** Handover document for developers.  
It explains **what the application is**, **why it exists**, **what success looks like**, and then provides the **technical spec** to build it.

---

# Part A — Product / Vision (Descriptive, non-technical but concrete)

## A1) What is this application?
This application is a **national discovery and publishing platform** for *Majlis Ilmu* (Islamic religious talks: kuliah, ceramah, tazkirah, forum) — starting in Malaysia.

Right now, Majlis Ilmu information is **fragmented** across:
- WhatsApp posters and forwards
- Facebook pages
- mosque noticeboards
- word-of-mouth

People miss talks or show up at the wrong time because details are unclear or outdated. Donation links can be inconsistent or even abused.

This platform becomes the **source of truth**: fast discovery, accurate details, trusted donation references, and optional registration.

## A2) Who is it for?
### Primary audiences
1) **Attendees (public users)**
- Find talks by location, date/time, topic, speaker.
- “Near me tonight” discovery.
- Save preferences and get alerts/digests.
- One page for everything: map, Waze, live link, recording, donation, registration.

2) **Institutions (Masjid/Surau admins)**
- Publish and update talks quickly.
- Share a clean event link and/or poster to WhatsApp groups.
- Attach verified donation accounts (QR/bank) safely.

3) **Speakers and their admins**
- Maintain a consistent profile.
- List upcoming talks and attach livestream/recording links.
- Update details with proper authorization.

4) **Moderators (platform ops)**
- Approve submissions, prevent spam, handle reports, keep info accurate.

### Secondary audiences (later)
- NGOs/community groups
- Religious authorities (optional partnerships)
- External sites using embeds/widgets (Phase 3)

## A3) The value proposition
### For attendees
- Find the right talk in seconds.
- Trust the details (approved listings + change controls).
- Save preferences; get notified.
- Navigate easily via Google Maps/Waze.
- Access livestream/recording links from one canonical page.

### For institutions
- Reduce confusion and repeated Q&A (“Ustaz siapa?”, “pukul berapa?”).
- Increase attendance and engagement.
- Donations are standardized under the institution identity.
- Manage multiple admins and event updates.

### For speakers
- Verified credibility.
- Centralized upcoming schedule + archive links.

### For moderators/platform
- Real tools to scale trust: moderation queue, reports, audit trails.

## A4) What does success look like?
### MVP success (first 90–120 days)
- Strong search usage (people return because it works).
- Dozens to hundreds of active institutions posting.
- Low error rate (few “wrong info” reports).
- Majority of traffic comes from **sharing** (WhatsApp) + **search engines** (SEO).

### Long term success
- “If you want Majlis Ilmu, check MajlisIlmu” becomes default behavior.
- Institutions prefer posting here because it reduces operational friction and improves attendance.

## A5) Product principles (non-negotiable)
1) **Trust-first:** donation references and event details must resist abuse.
2) **Discovery-first:** search must be fast and intuitive.
3) **WhatsApp-native:** sharing is core; links/posters must be simple.
4) **Moderation-enabled:** allow public submissions but enforce accuracy.
5) **Low friction:** web/PWA works on any phone; no app install requirement for MVP.

## A6) Example user journeys
### Journey 1 — Attendee: “Kuliah Maghrib near me”
1. Opens site on phone
2. Tap “Near me tonight”
3. Sees upcoming talks with distance + time
4. Opens talk page → taps Waze → attends

### Journey 2 — Institution admin posts a weekly program
1. Logs in → Institution dashboard
2. Creates event (MVP) / template (Phase 2)
3. Submit → moderation approves
4. Shares link/poster to WhatsApp groups

### Journey 3 — Public user submits an event
1. Uses “Submit event” form
2. Enters talk details (Phase 3: poster upload)
3. Event goes to moderation queue
4. Approved → published + searchable

### Journey 4 — Private event requiring registration
1. Event marked registration_required + private/unlisted
2. Organizer shares invite link
3. Attendees register
4. Organizer exports attendee list

## A7) MVP feature set (human-readable)
- Search + filters (state, district, speaker, topic, date, language, genre)
- Event page: maps, Waze, live link, recording link, donation, registration
- Save searches + daily/weekly digest email
- Institution dashboard: manage events, admins, donation accounts
- Moderation tools: approve/reject/needs-changes
- Reporting + audit trail

# Part B — Technical Specification (Build guide)

## B1) Tech stack
- **Backend:** Laravel 12
- **Database:** Postgres
- **Admin:** Filament
- **Search:** Typesense via Laravel Scout
- **Queue:** Redis + Horizon
- **Storage:** S3/R2 (QR, posters)
- **IDs:** UUIDv7 (Laravel 12)
- **Monitoring:** Sentry

## B2) Architecture
Use a modular monolith:
- Domain modules + service layer
- Policies for authorization
- Jobs for async indexing + notifications
- Optional outbox for reliable search sync

## B3) Database schema overview
Entities:
- Users, Institutions, Venues, Speakers, Events, Series, Topics, Donation Accounts
Workflow:
- Event submissions, moderation reviews, reports, audit logs
User features:
- Saved searches, bookmarks, registrations
Supporting:
- states/districts, media_assets

**Reference migrations**
- Core schema: `database.md` (UUIDv7 migration)
- Typesense outbox add-on (optional): `majlisilmu_schema_uuidv7_typesense.md`

## B3a) Domain invariants and enums (baseline)
- Event visibility:
  - `public`: listed in search, indexable.
  - `unlisted`: accessible by direct link only, not listed in search.
  - `private`: only visible to authorized users (organizers, moderators).
- Event status:
  - `draft`: not visible to public, no indexing.
  - `pending`: awaiting moderation.
  - `approved`: public and indexable (if visibility allows).
  - `rejected`: not public, show to submitter with reason.
  - `cancelled`/`postponed`: public but clearly marked, not recommended in search results.
- Verification status (institution, speaker, donation account): `unverified`, `pending`, `verified`, `rejected`.
- Donation safety:
  - Donation accounts belong to institutions.
  - Events can only reference donation accounts owned by their institution.
- Geo rules:
  - Event location inherits from venue when present; fall back to institution address.
  - Search requires lat/lng for distance sorting; if missing, fall back to time + relevance only.
- **Event timing modes** (prayer-relative scheduling):
  - `absolute`: Event scheduled at a specific clock time (e.g., 10:00 AM).
  - `prayer_relative`: Event scheduled relative to prayer times (e.g., "selepas Maghrib").
  - Prayer references: `fajr` (Subuh), `dhuhr` (Zohor), `asr` (Asar), `maghrib`, `isha` (Isyak), `friday_prayer` (Jumaat).
  - Prayer offsets: `before_30`, `before_15`, `immediately` (5 min buffer), `after_15`, `after_30`, `after_45`, `after_60`.
  - Display text auto-generated (e.g., "Selepas Maghrib", "30 minit selepas Isyak").
  - `starts_at` is always calculated and stored for search/filtering.
  - Prayer times fetched via Aladhan API using venue coordinates.


## B4) Workflows (technical)
### Event lifecycle
- Create draft (institution members) → submit → `pending`
- Public submission → `pending` (no draft state)
- Moderator → approve/reject/needs-changes
- Approved → searchable (Typesense) + public (if visibility allows)
- Post-approval sensitive change → `pending` + review created
- Cancelled/postponed → stays public but clearly marked and deboosted in search

### Sensitive change gating
Time, venue, donation, visibility, speaker list → status becomes pending + review created.

### Donation safety
Donation accounts belong to institutions. Events reference `donation_account_id` only.

### Search indexing
- Scout/Typesense indexing on approved event updates.
- Optional outbox for reliability and backfills.

### Notifications
- Saved searches send daily/weekly digests via queued job.

## B4a) Moderation workflow and notification rules
### Moderation workflow
- Each moderation action creates a `moderation_reviews` record with `decision`, `reason_code`, and optional `note`.
- Approved events:
  - Set `status=approved`, set `published_at`, enqueue search indexing.
- Needs changes:
  - Keep `status=pending` and mark latest review as `needs_changes`.
  - UI should surface the latest review note and required fields to the submitter.
- Rejected:
  - Set `status=rejected`, de-index from search.
  - Submitter can edit and resubmit; resubmission creates a new review.
- Sensitive change gating (time/venue/donation/visibility/speakers):
  - Set `status=pending` and create a new review.
  - Remove from public search until re-approved (direct link can show "pending update").
- Reports flow:
  - Report starts at `open`, then `triaged`, then `resolved` or `dismissed`.
  - If a report indicates wrong info or abuse, event is set to `pending` or `rejected` based on severity.

### Notification rules
- Channels: in-app + email (MVP). All notifications are queued.
- On submission (public or institution):
  - Notify moderators; include event title, institution, and time.
- On approval:
  - Notify submitter and institution admins; include public link.
- On needs changes:
  - Notify submitter and institution admins; include review note and required edits.
- On rejection:
  - Notify submitter and institution admins; include reason and resubmission guidance.
- On sensitive change gating:
  - Notify moderators and submitter that an approved event is back in review.
- On report resolution:
  - Notify reporter of outcome when resolved or dismissed.
- SLA escalation:
  - Pending > 48 hours: notify moderators.
  - Pending > 72 hours: notify super admin.
- Idempotency:
  - Deduplicate notifications per event + decision to avoid duplicates on retries.

## B4b) Registration workflow (MVP)
- Registration is allowed only when `status=approved` and the event is not `cancelled`/`rejected`.
- If `registration_required=false`, the registration endpoint returns 403.
- Open/close window:
  - If `registration_opens_at` is null, registration opens immediately.
  - If `registration_closes_at` is set and in the past, registration is closed.
- Capacity:
  - If `capacity` is null, registrations are unlimited.
  - If `registrations_count >= capacity`, return 409 conflict.
- Guest registration:
  - Require `name` and one of `email` or `phone`.
  - Dedupe by `email` per event when provided; otherwise by `phone`.
- Cancellation:
  - Update `status=cancelled` and decrement `registrations_count`.
  - Keep record for audit; do not delete rows.

## B4c) Saved search digest workflow (MVP)
- Daily digest: runs 08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, includes approved public events:
  - `starts_at` within the next 14 days
  - `updated_at` within the last 24 hours
- Weekly digest: runs Monday 08:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, includes approved public events:
  - `starts_at` within the next 30 days
  - `updated_at` within the last 7 days
- One email per user per run, grouped by saved search.
- Dedupe by event ID within the email.
- Cap results to 30 events per email to avoid overload.

## B5) Routes / APIs (REST)

Current mobile-facing API contract lives in `docs/MAJLISILMU_MOBILE_API_REFERENCE.md`.

Public:
- `GET /events` search/list (+ geo)

## B6) Authorization
- Global roles: spatie/laravel-permission (`super_admin`, `moderator`)
- Scoped roles: `institution_user`, `speaker_user`
- Laravel Policies enforce all access.

## B6a) Authorization matrix (high level)
- Public:
  - Read public events, institutions, speakers, series.
  - Submit event (with captcha and rate limit).
- Authenticated user:
  - Manage own saved searches, bookmarks, registrations.
  - Report content.
- Institution member:
  - Manage institution profile, venues, donation accounts.
  - Create and edit institution events.
- Speaker member:
  - Manage speaker profile and associated events (where authorized).
- Moderator:
  - Approve/reject/needs-changes, resolve reports, manage trust flags.
- Super admin:
  - Full access, role management, system settings.

## B6b) Trust scoring, auto-approval, and escalation (MVP)
### Trust score model
- Trust score range: 0..100 (stored on institutions and speakers).
- Baselines:
  - `unverified`: 10
  - `pending`: 20
  - `verified`: 70
  - `rejected`: 0
- Manual overrides:
  - Moderators can adjust trust score in increments of 5 with a reason code.
- Automatic adjustments (weekly job):
  - +10 if the last 20 approved events had zero valid reports.
  - -20 if any `donation_scam` report is confirmed.
  - -10 if two or more valid reports occur within 30 days.

### Effective event trust score
- Use the max of:
  - institution trust score
  - highest speaker trust score (if speakers exist)
- If event is submitted by public (no institution), treat trust score as 0.

### Auto-approval rules
- Public submissions: never auto-approve.
- Institution submissions:
  - Auto-approve if institution is `verified` and effective trust score >= 80.
  - Event must start at least 24 hours in the future.
  - Content must be "non-sensitive" change only (title/description/topics/media links).
- Sensitive changes (time/venue/donation/visibility/speakers):
  - Always require moderation review, regardless of trust score.
- Anti-duplication:
  - If event title + starts_at + venue matches an existing approved event within 7 days, auto-approval is blocked.

### Escalation thresholds
- High-risk report categories (`donation_scam`, `fake_speaker`):
  - Immediately set event to `pending` and remove from search.
  - Notify moderators and super admin.
- Two unique reports within 24 hours:
  - Set to `pending` and flag in moderation queue.
- Event starts within 6 hours and is still `pending`:
  - Mark as priority and notify moderators.

## B7) Filament admin panel plan
Filament Resources:
- InstitutionResource
- VenueResource
- SpeakerResource
- EventResource
- DonationAccountResource
- TopicResource
- ReportResource
Custom Pages:
- ModerationQueuePage (pending events + actions)

## B7a) Moderation UI requirements (MVP)
- Queue views:
  - Tabs: `pending`, `needs_changes`, `reports`, `high_risk`, `recently_rejected`.
  - Filters: state, district, institution, speaker, date range, source, trust score, report category.
- Event review panel:
  - Side-by-side diff: current approved version vs. submitted changes.
  - Trust indicators: institution verification, trust score, report history.
  - Context: previous reviews, prior approvals/rejections, and submitter history.
- Actions:
  - Approve, reject, needs changes, and request clarification.
  - Reason code selector with templates for common issues.
  - Optional moderator note (required on reject and needs changes).
- Safety tooling:
  - Quick "remove from search" toggle.
  - Flag donation account for verification review.
  - Duplicate detection hints (title + time + venue matches).
- SLA visibility:
  - Show time in queue and escalation countdown.
- Auditability:
  - All actions recorded to audit_logs with actor and before/after payloads.

## B8) Typesense design
Collection: `events`

Suggested fields:
- identifiers: id, slug
- text: title, description, speaker_names, institution_name, venue_name
- filters: state_id, district_id, language, genre, audience, topic_ids, speaker_ids, status, visibility
- time: starts_at, ends_at
- geo: lat, lng
- signals: saves_count, registrations_count, trust_score (optional ranking)

## B8a) Typesense indexing and ranking
- Index only `approved` + `public` events.
- De-index events that become `private`, `unlisted`, `rejected`, or deleted.
- Ranking:
  - Primary: relevance to query text.
  - Boost: upcoming events within 30 days.
  - Secondary: trust_score, saves_count, registrations_count.
- Facets: state_id, district_id, topic_ids, speaker_ids, language, genre, audience.
- Near me: geo sort when lat/lng provided, fallback to starts_at.

## B9) Ops requirements
- Horizon for queues
- Rate limiting + captcha on public submit
- Backups
- Sentry

## B9a) Non-functional requirements (MVP targets)
- Search response p95 <= 300ms (Typesense), event page render <= 1s server time.
- p95 indexing latency <= 2 minutes after approval.
- Sitemaps refreshed daily; event pages include canonical URLs.
- Basic caching for public list pages (60s) and event pages (5m) with cache bust on update.
- Audit logs for moderation actions and sensitive changes.

## B9b) SEO, metadata, and sitemaps (MVP)
- Canonical URLs:
  - Events: `/events/{slug}` with permanent 301 from old slugs if changed.
  - Institutions, speakers, venues, series use their slug routes.
- Indexing rules:
  - `public` + `approved` events are indexable.
  - `unlisted`, `private`, `draft`, `pending`, and `rejected` use `noindex, nofollow`.
- Metadata:
  - Title: `{event_title} | {institution_name} | MajlisIlmu`.
  - Description: first 160 chars of event description.
  - OpenGraph + Twitter cards include title, description, start time, and image when available.
- Structured data:
  - Use JSON-LD `Event` with `name`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `location`, `organizer`, `eventAttendanceMode`, and `eventStatus`.
- Sitemaps:
  - `sitemap-index.xml` with separate sitemaps for events, institutions, speakers, and series.
  - Events sitemap updated daily; others weekly.
  - Maximum 50,000 URLs per sitemap.
- Robots:
  - `robots.txt` references `sitemap-index.xml`.

## B9c) Observability and analytics (MVP)
- Tooling:
  - Sentry for backend exceptions and queue failures.
  - PostHog for product analytics events.
  - Metabase for operational dashboards (read-only DB role).
  - Horizon for queue monitoring.
- Error tracking:
  - Tag with `request_id`, route name, user_id (if authenticated), and event_id where relevant.
- Performance:
  - Track search response time (p50/p95/p99), event page render time, and queue processing time.
  - Monitor Typesense latency separately from DB latency.
- Product event schema (PostHog):
  - `search_performed` (q, filters_count, results_count, sort, has_geo)
  - `search_result_clicked` (event_id, position)
  - `event_viewed` (event_id, source)
  - `event_shared` (event_id, channel)
  - `event_saved` (event_id)
  - `event_registered` (event_id, is_guest)
  - `submission_started` / `submission_submitted` (source)
  - `moderation_decision` (event_id, decision, reason_code)
  - `report_created` (entity_type, category)
- Dashboards to build first:
  - Moderation SLA: pending count, median time to decision, >48h backlog.
  - Search quality: queries/day, zero-result rate, CTR on results, top filters.
  - Supply pipeline: submissions by source, approval rate, time to publish.
  - Trust and abuse: reports per 100 events, high-risk categories, repeat offenders.
  - Ops health: queue depth, indexing latency, error rate by job.

## B9d) Security, privacy, and data retention (MVP)
- Transport and session:
  - HTTPS only, secure cookies, and HSTS in production.
  - CSRF protection on all form posts.
- Input safety:
  - Event descriptions are stored as plain text; strip HTML.
  - URLs are validated and must be `https` for livestream/recording/donation links.
- Access control:
  - Policies enforce data access for institutions and speakers.
  - Exports of registrations require institution owner/admin role and are audit logged.
- Data retention:
  - Registrations PII retained for 6 months after event end, then anonymized (keep counts).
  - Reports retained for 24 months; reporter contact is removed after 6 months.
  - Audit logs retained for 24 months.
  - Application logs retained for 60 days.
  - Data deletion requests fulfilled within 30 days; keep a hashed suppression list for opt-outs.

## B9e) Abuse controls and rate limits (MVP)
- Rate limits (guest/IP, authenticated/user):
  - `GET /events`: 60/min, 180/min.
  - `GET /events/{slug}`: 120/min, 240/min.
  - `POST /event-submissions`: 3/day + 1/hour, 10/day.
  - `POST /reports`: 3/day, 10/day.
  - `POST /events/{event}/registrations`: 5/hour, 20/day.
  - `POST /saved-searches`: 30/day (auth only).
- Captcha:
  - Required for guest submissions and guest reports.
  - Trigger for guest registrations after 3 attempts/hour.
- Duplicate prevention:
  - Block submissions that match title + starts_at + venue within 7 days.
  - Block repeated reports from the same user/IP for the same entity within 24 hours.

## B9f) Backups and disaster recovery (MVP)
- Database:
  - Daily full backup with 30-day retention.
  - Weekly backup retained for 12 weeks.
  - Monthly backup retained for 12 months.
- Storage:
  - Enable bucket versioning for S3/R2.
  - Keep deleted media for 30 days to allow recovery.
- Restore testing:
  - Perform a restore test at least once per quarter.

## B10) Testing
- Policy tests (auth)
- Workflow tests (pending→approved)
- Sensitive change gating tests
- Search indexing job tests (mock Typesense)
- Digest tests
- Registration capacity and duplicate checks
- Rate limiting and captcha enforcement
- SEO metadata and structured data rendering

## B11) Implementation order
1) Auth + roles + policies
2) Migrations + models + relationships
3) Filament CRUD resources
4) Moderation queue and status workflow
5) Public pages + search endpoints
6) Typesense integration (Scout)
7) Saved searches + digest emails
8) Registrations + exports
9) Reports + resolution
10) Harden: rate limits, audit logs, monitoring
11) SEO + sitemap + metadata
12) Analytics + operational dashboards

---

# Part C — Roadmap awareness (for future-proofing)

## Phase 2
- Series templates (recurring scheduling)
- Follow speaker/institution
- Push notifications
- QR check-in
- Poster generator

## Phase 3 (1000×)
- Poster-to-event extraction pipeline
- Widgets/embeds for masjid sites
- Partner API (read-only)
- Reputation-based auto-approval

---

# Part D — Decisions (MVP defaults)
- Public event submissions allow guest submissions with phone/email + captcha; login is optional and unlocks faster moderation and edit history.
- Moderation SLA target: 24 hours. Escalation: pending > 48 hours triggers moderator review alert; pending > 72 hours escalates to super admin.
- Geo provider: Google Maps is canonical for place IDs and geocoding. Waze URL is generated from lat/lng using the universal link format.
- Unlisted events are not in public search; they remain visible in the institution dashboard and by direct link.
- Pagination: `page` + `per_page` for MVP; cursor pagination can be added later for high-volume feeds.
