# Majlisilmu MVP Feature Checklist

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-15
**Document Purpose:** Track current MVP implementation status against the live codebase (routes, Livewire pages, Filament resources, services, jobs, and tests).

This checklist distinguishes between:

- true MVP work still missing
- deliberate product-policy decisions
- superseded architecture that should not remain as fake TODOs

---

## MVP Health Snapshot

| Pillar | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Public Pages & Core Discovery | DONE | Browse, detail, submission, calendar, share, SEO, and discovery flows are live. |
| Authenticated User Features | DONE | Auth, saved events/searches, registrations, dashboard flows, and settings are implemented. |
| Institution Dashboard | MOSTLY DONE | Operational dashboard, scoped Ahli links, member management, and invitations are live; attendee export UX remains. |
| Admin/Moderation (Filament) | PARTIAL | Core queue, resources, and moderation actions are implemented; reviewer ergonomics remain incomplete. |
| API Surface | DONE | Public and authenticated MVP API endpoints are implemented. |
| Search & Discovery | DONE | Full-text, geo, and advanced filter UI are implemented with Typesense + DB fallback. |
| Infrastructure & Operations | PARTIAL | Core scheduling, notifications, indexing, and logging are implemented; Horizon and numeric trust-score automation are not. |

## True Remaining MVP Work

### Institution Self-Service
- [ ] Export attendee list from institution self-service UI

Note: the CSV backend already exists at `GET /api/v1/events/{id}/registrations/export`, but the institution-facing Ahli/dashboard flow still lacks an export action.

### Moderator Reviewer Ergonomics
- [ ] Side-by-side diff view for submitted event vs current event
- [ ] SLA visibility in moderation queue UI (overdue / age indicators)
- [ ] Duplicate detection hints in moderation queue UI

Note: the moderation queue already supports core review actions. These remaining items are reviewer-speed features, not core moderation correctness gaps.

## Deliberate Policy Decisions

- The `event-submission` limiter exists, but it is intentionally not attached to the public `submit-event.create` route in the current product policy.
- Institution event creation is intentionally split across the advanced parent-program builder and the stable submit-event flow, instead of a separate dashboard-only CRUD creator.

---

## Superseded Architecture

- `TopicResource` is no longer a real admin-resource goal; taxonomy-backed `TagResource` is the active architecture.
- `EventTypeResource` is not a standalone resource in the current architecture; event type is enum-backed application data.

---

## Deferred / Beyond Current MVP

- Horizon dashboard setup is not configured in-app yet.
- Numeric trust-score model, auto-approval, and weekly trust-score recalculation are not implemented.

Note: the current trust layer is credibility-based public-submission lock / unlock automation, not a numeric trust-score system.

---

## Phase 2 / Post-MVP

- [ ] Recurring series automation / recurring child-event generation
- [x] Follow speaker / institution
- [ ] Browser web push notifications
- [ ] QR-based on-site check-in
- [ ] Distinguish check-in source in attendance records (`button` vs `qr_scan`)
- [ ] Poster generator

Note:

- Parent-program templates already exist for weekly / weekend / Ramadan-style setup.
- Push-device registration and push delivery already exist for signed-in mobile-app/device flows; the unchecked item here is browser web push specifically.
- Standard self check-in already exists; the unchecked item here is QR-based check-in UX.

---

## Review Notes (2026-03-15)

1. The previous checklist had architecture drift (`TopicResource` and `EventTypeResource` were lingering as fake active TODOs). The current architecture is `TagResource` plus enum-backed `EventType`.
2. Submit-event throttling is intentionally disabled on the public submit route despite a defined `event-submission` limiter, so it should be tracked as policy, not as an implementation miss.
3. Numeric trust-score automation remains unimplemented; the current trust layer is credibility-based public-submission lock and unlock automation.
4. The true MVP tail is now intentionally small: institution self-service attendee export UX plus moderation reviewer ergonomics.
