# MajlisIlmu MCP - User Guide (English)

**For: Members, volunteers, ops staff, mosque/surau committee members, and anyone who just wants to use AI without digging through technical stuff**  
**Last Updated: April 2026**  
**Purpose: Help you use MajlisIlmu through ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or other AI assistants in plain, everyday language**

---

## So... what is MCP actually?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is basically the bridge between AI assistants (like ChatGPT) and MajlisIlmu.

In simple terms: instead of ChatGPT simply guessing, it can check the proper data in MajlisIlmu and reply with something useful. So you don’t have to click around the site hunting for things one by one like you’re searching through ten tabs after Isyak.

**What can you do with it?**
- Search for events, speakers, institutions, references
- Ask questions about past events
- Get summaries and reports
- Claim membership
- Submit evidence for membership verification
- Update your institution or speaker information
- Track your contributions

**What you still can’t do through MCP:**
- Delete records (permanent destruction)
- Access other people's private information
- Bypass access rules or security checks

---

## Before you start

### For ChatGPT Users

1. **Open ChatGPT** and start a conversation
2. **Click the "+" menu** (bottom left or in the config area)
3. **Select "Add custom GPT" or "Connect to service"**
4. **Choose "MajlisIlmu Member MCP"** (if you're a member) or **"MajlisIlmu Admin MCP"** (if you're an admin)
5. **Authenticate** using your login credentials
6. Done — after that you can just start asking normally.

### For Other AI Assistants (Gemini, Claude, etc.)

Just ask your AI assistant to connect to MajlisIlmu MCP and follow the login steps it shows you. If it asks for permissions, give them a quick once-over first so you know what it’s accessing.

---

## How should you ask? Honestly, just talk normally

No need to sound formal. You can ask the way you’d ask a helpful admin staff member or committee person.

### Example 1: Search for Events

**You can ask:**
> "Find events happening in Kuala Lumpur next week"

**What the AI does behind the scenes:**
- Searches MajlisIlmu's event database
- Filters for your location and dates
- Retrieves results

**What you usually get back:**
- List of events with:
  - Event name
  - Date and time
  - Location
  - Organizer (mosque, institution)
  - Number of attendees
  - Registration link (if applicable)

---

### Example 2: Want details about a speaker

**You ask:**
> "Can you tell me a bit about Ustaz Ahmad from Kuala Lumpur?"

**ChatGPT does:**
- Searches for speakers named Ahmad in KL
- Retrieves speaker profile

**You receive:**
- Speaker name and title
- Biography/background
- Specializations (e.g., Islamic finance, Quranic studies)
- Recent events where they spoke
- Contact information (if public)
- Profile picture

---

### Example 3: Check Your Membership Status

**You ask:**
> "What's my membership status?"

**ChatGPT does:**
- Retrieves your member profile
- Checks contribution requests
- Checks membership claims

**You receive:**
- Current membership status
- Pending actions or approvals
- Next steps needed

---

### Example 4: Submit evidence for membership

**You ask:**
> "I want to submit proof of authority for my speaker status. I have a letter of authorization. How do I do this?"

**ChatGPT responds with:**

1. **Explanation of requirements:**
   - What documents are acceptable (PDF, JPG, PNG)
   - Maximum file size
   - What the admin will be looking for

2. **Simple next step:**
   - “Okay, upload the document first.”
   - You click and pick the file from your phone or computer

3. **A widget pops up** (if your AI client supports file upload):
   - A file picker opens
   - You select your document
   - ChatGPT automatically handles the upload

4. **Confirmation:**
   - “Okay, your document is in. Your membership claim is now waiting for review.”
   - You receive a reference number

---

### Example 5: List All Events You Can Contribute To

**You ask:**
> "Show me upcoming events where I might speak"

**ChatGPT does:**
- Retrieves your speaker profile
- Searches for events that need speakers in your specialization area
- Matches based on your location, expertise, and availability

**You receive:**
- List of events:
  - Event name
  - Organizer
  - Date
  - Current speaker status (confirmed, pending, needed)
  - Why it matches your profile

---

## When the AI replies, what are you actually looking at?

Sometimes the reply looks long, but most of the time it’s just neatly structured. So don’t worry — you usually only need to scan the key parts.

## Widgets: When Do They Appear?

### What is a widget?

A **widget** is the interactive thing that appears inside the chat. So instead of reading a wall of text, you might get buttons, a form, a calendar, or a file upload box. In other words, when something needs clicking, choosing, or uploading, the AI can show it properly instead of asking you to imagine the interface.

**How to use:**
- Click on a date
- ChatGPT shows events for that date

---

#### 3. **Search Results Widget**

## Questions people usually ask

### Q: "How do I upload a photo?"
**A:** Easy. When ChatGPT asks you for media — like a profile photo, event poster, or gallery image — it will show an upload widget. Click **Choose file**, pick the image from your phone or computer, and upload it. Common accepted formats are **JPG, PNG, and WebP**. Max size is usually **10 MB per file**. If it acts up the first time, don’t panic — just retry once or switch the file format.

---

### Q: "What if I submitted the wrong thing?"
**A:** No problem — just tell ChatGPT what went wrong. Usually it will help you either:
1. **Re-submit** with correct information, OR
2. **Contact support** to request correction by an admin

---

### Q: "Can ChatGPT see my phone number or email?"
**A:** Nope. MajlisIlmu hides sensitive information like:
- Email address
- Phone number
- Private addresses
- Payment information
- Prayer institution preferences

Only admins and you can see this data.

---

### Q: "What if I disconnect ChatGPT from MajlisIlmu?"
**A:** Just reconnect! Your data remains safe. To reconnect:
1. Open ChatGPT
2. Go to settings
3. Find "MajlisIlmu" in connected services
4. Click "Connect" again
5. Authenticate

No data is lost.

---

### Q: "How do I know my submission went through?"
**A:** ChatGPT will usually confirm straight away. If you get a reference number, keep it somewhere safe because that makes follow-up much easier:
- ✅ "Submitted successfully!" (green checkmark)
- ⏳ "Submitted! Your request is pending review." (clock icon)
- ❌ "Error: [reason]" (if something went wrong)

Most of the time you’ll also get a **Reference Number** so you can track it later.

---

### Q: "Can ChatGPT delete my data?"
**A:** No. ChatGPT cannot:
- Delete events, institutions, speakers, or references
- Delete your personal account
- Delete submitted contributions or claims

Only admins can delete records, and only after a formal review process.

---

### Q: "What if ChatGPT gives me wrong information?"
**A:** This is rare, but if it happens, just correct it calmly and give clearer context:
1. Tell ChatGPT: "That information seems incorrect"
2. Provide what you think is correct
3. Ask ChatGPT to refresh the data
4. If the problem persists, create a support ticket: "Ask ChatGPT to report this issue"

---

### Q: "How do I find events near me?"
**A:** Just ask normally, for example:
- "Show me events in [city name]"
- "Find events near me this weekend"
- "What's happening in Kuala Lumpur next month?"

ChatGPT filters based on your location preference (set in your profile).

---

### Q: "Can I search by topic or expertise?"
**A:** Yes! Ask ChatGPT:
- "Find events about Islamic finance"
- "Show me speakers specializing in Quranic interpretation"
- "Find references on Islamic finance"

ChatGPT searches through tags, descriptions, and expertise areas.

---

### Q: "What does it mean if an event says 'Pending Review'?"
**A:** The event has been submitted but hasn't been approved by an admin yet. It won't appear in public searches. Status meanings:
- **Draft** = Organizer is still editing
- **Pending Review** = Waiting for admin approval
- **Approved** = Public and visible
- **Rejected** = Admin declined (usually with feedback)
- **Archived** = Old event kept for records

---

### Q: "How long does approval usually take?"
**A:** 
- Membership claims: 1-3 business days
- Event approvals: 24-48 hours
- Contribution requests: Immediate (auto-approved) or 1-2 days if flagged
- Report triage: 2-5 business days

---

## Privacy & Security

This part matters because most people will naturally ask, “Okay, but what exactly can the AI see?” Fair question.

### What ChatGPT Can See
- ✅ Public information (events, speakers, institutions)
- ✅ Your contributions and memberships
- ✅ Your own submissions and profile
- ✅ Publicly listed contact info (phone, email you chose to share)

### What ChatGPT CANNOT See
- ❌ Other members' private email/phone
- ❌ Private addresses
- ❌ Payment or donation history
- ❌ Private messages
- ❌ Admin-only moderation notes
- ❌ Unreleased events or content

### Your Data Security
- All communication is encrypted (HTTPS)
- Your password is never shared with MCP
- You authenticate once, then ChatGPT uses a secure token
- Tokens expire after 24 hours (you'll re-authenticate)
- You can disconnect ChatGPT at any time

---

## If something feels off, try this first

### "ChatGPT says 'Documentation not loaded'"
**That’s usually normal:** on first use, ChatGPT may load the MajlisIlmu guide first. Just repeat your question once more and it should continue properly. Usually it’s just a first-run hiccup.

---

### "I see 'Authentication required' or 'Access denied'"
**Fix:** Your login token expired. To fix:
1. Disconnect MajlisIlmu from ChatGPT
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Reconnect
4. Log in again

---

### "File upload is not working"
**Try these first:**
- Make sure your file is under 10 MB
- Try a different file format (JPG instead of PNG)
- Check your internet connection
- Try again in 1 minute

If it still doesn’t work, just say: **"Please report this upload issue."** If you can, mention the file type and rough size too.

---

### "ChatGPT is giving me irrelevant results"
**Fix:** Try being more specific:
- Instead of: "Find events" → Ask: "Find Islamic education events in Selangor on April 30"
- Instead of: "Show me speakers" → Ask: "Show me Arabic language speakers in KL"

---

### "I think my membership was approved but ChatGPT didn't tell me"
**Fix:** Ask ChatGPT: "Check my membership status" or "Show my pending claims"

---

## Need help?

### Best order to try:
1. **Ask ChatGPT first** — it can solve a lot of things on the spot
2. **Check this guide** — scroll up if you’re stuck
3. **Report an issue** — say: **"Create a support ticket for [problem]"**
4. **Contact an admin** — share your reference number if you have one, so they don’t need to start from zero

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts (If Using Browser)

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + F` (Windows) or `Cmd + F` (Mac) | Search within results |
| `Enter` | Confirm selection or submit form |
| `Esc` | Close widget or cancel |
| `↑ ↓` Arrow keys | Navigate through options |

---

## Quick tips so life is easier

### Tip 1: Just talk normally
ChatGPT understands normal questions:
- ✅ "What events are happening next Friday?"
- ✅ "Tell me about Ustaz Ahmad"
- ✅ "I want to update my speaker photo"

No need to sound technical or fancy. Normal human language is perfectly fine.

---

### Tip 2: Ask follow-up questions
ChatGPT usually remembers the current context:
- You: "Show me events in KL"
- ChatGPT: "[Shows results]"
- You: "Which one has the most attendees?"
- ChatGPT: "[Compares and answers]"

---

### Tip 3: Request Summaries
- "Give me a one-paragraph summary of this event"
- "List the top 5 speakers in Islamic finance"
- "Compare these three institutions"

---

### Tip 4: Tell it your preferences early
Tell ChatGPT your preferences once:
- "My preferred location is Klang"
- "I specialize in Islamic finance and business ethics"
- "I prefer events on weekends"

ChatGPT will remember for future searches.
