    Canonical API documentation for Majlis Ilmu client and platform integrations.

    Get an access token by calling POST /auth/login or POST /auth/register with a device_name, then send the returned access_token as Authorization: Bearer {token}. For integrations that should not store an account password, super admins can issue and revoke long-lived personal access tokens from Admin > Authz > User > API Access for the selected user.

    ROUTING SURFACES:

    Public routes (/api/v1/speakers, /api/v1/institutions, etc.) return only active and verified records (is_active=true AND status=verified).

    Admin routes (/api/v1/admin/speakers, etc.) return all records by default. Event collections expose explicit filters such as filter[status], filter[visibility], filter[event_format], filter[event_type], filter[timing_mode], and filter[prayer_reference]. Speaker collections expose filter[status], filter[is_active], and filter[has_events]. Date-aware admin resources also accept starts_after, starts_before, and starts_on_local_date.

    The same search= parameter on both surfaces returns different result sets by design.

    Collection endpoints clamp per_page to server-supported maxima. Public /events, /institutions, and /speakers currently cap at 50. Most authenticated collections and admin resource listings currently cap at 100.

    Do not send public contribution payloads to /admin endpoints and do not expect admin schemas from /forms endpoints.

    TIMEZONE:

    Raw API timestamp fields are stored and returned in UTC (ISO 8601 with Z suffix).

    Viewer-facing helper fields such as event timing_display and end_time_display are localized only when the request provides timezone context (authenticated user preference, X-Timezone, user_timezone, cookie, or session). Without timezone context, bare API requests fall back to UTC.

    Public event date-only filters use `filter[starts_after]`, `filter[starts_before]`, and `filter[starts_on_local_date]`. Admin resource date-only filters use top-level `starts_after`, `starts_before`, and `starts_on_local_date`. All of these are interpreted in the resolved request timezone and converted to UTC day boundaries before querying.

    For MYT today requests, send X-Timezone: Asia/Kuala_Lumpur with either public-event values such as filter[starts_after]=2026-04-12&filter[starts_before]=2026-04-12 or admin-resource values such as starts_after=2026-04-12&starts_before=2026-04-12.

    The server timezone is UTC. The web application commonly supplies Asia/Kuala_Lumpur as user timezone context, but API consumers should not assume MYT unless they send it explicitly.

    PUBLIC FLOWS:

    Public create flows currently exist for events, institutions, and speakers.

    Public update flows currently exist for events, institutions, speakers, and references via the contribution suggestion endpoints; those updates either apply immediately (mode=direct_edit) or create a review request (mode=review) depending on the caller's permissions.

    Public API support does not currently include creating references, venues, or series, and it does not currently include updating venues or series through the contribution endpoints.

    When you need required versus optional fields, defaults, catalog lookups, or conditional rules for a public mutation, fetch the corresponding GET /forms/* contract first.

    For public update suggestions specifically, fetch GET /forms/contributions/{subjectType}/{subject}/suggest first to get the current state, sparse editable fields, and direct-edit media capabilities.

    GET /catalogs/spaces returns only global spaces when institution_id is omitted, and returns global plus institution-linked spaces when institution_id is provided.

    GET /institution-workspace auto-selects the first accessible institution when institution_id is omitted and always returns selected_institution together with events_pagination and members_pagination metadata.

    Public institution, speaker, and submit-event writes must include an explicit country selection using the canonical *_country_id fields.

    Speaker create/update still forbids detailed street or map fields: address.line1, address.line2, address.postcode, address.lat, address.lng, address.google_maps_url, address.google_place_id, and address.waze_url return HTTP 422 on speaker contribution flows.

    ADMIN FLOWS:

    Admin create and update flows are schema-driven: discover writable resources with GET /admin/manifest, then fetch the exact contract with GET /admin/{resourceKey}/schema?operation=create or GET /admin/{resourceKey}/schema?operation=update&recordKey={recordKey}.

    The recordKey parameter should use the record route_key returned by the admin collection or record-detail responses. If you only have a public UUID-backed payload and route_key is unavailable, use the UUID id directly as recordKey.

    Admin PUT is not a partial update. Fields marked required in the schema must be sent on every update, not just on create.

    For speakers: name, gender, and status are always required on both create and update.

    For institutions: name, type, and status are always required on both create and update.

    The allow_public_event_submission field is only accepted on PUT (update), not on POST (create).

    For admin geography lookups, use the authenticated GET /admin/catalogs/* endpoints referenced by schema catalog metadata.

    Current admin write support includes events, institutions, speakers, references, venues, and subdistricts.

    Admin write support is limited to resources whose write_support.schema flag is true in the admin manifest.
